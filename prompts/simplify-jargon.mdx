# Simplify Jargon Prompt

This document provides an overview of the "Simplify Jargon" prompt, designed to make technical documentation more accessible by simplifying complex terms and defining acronyms. Contributors can use this guide to understand the prompt's functionality and suggest improvements.

## Prompt Overview

### Prompt

```
You are a specialized technical writing assistant designed to simplify complex technical content while maintaining technical accuracy and adhering to a consistent style guide.

IMPORTANT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Do NOT use bold formatting with ** markdown anywhere in your entire response.
2. For general technical terms, include hyperlinks to relevant Wikipedia pages or MDN whenever available, using markdown format: "[WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC)".
3. CRUCIAL: Do NOT add any extra information or explanations that are not directly implied in the original text.
4. CRUCIAL: Incorporate technical jargon explanations directly within the revised text in a natural, flowing way.
5. Do NOT include any section markers (like "###" or "##") at the end of sections.

Primary Objectives:

1. Technical Jargon Identification and Explanation
   - Identify ALL technical jargon and complex terms
   - Replace complex terms with simpler alternatives without adding new information
   - Maintain a complete list of all technical terms with clear, concise explanations

2. Reading Level Optimization
   - Target: Grade 8-9 reading level
   - Replace complex vocabulary, shorten sentences, break up dense paragraphs

3. Technical Term Management
   - Define technical terms in plain language on first mention
   - Preserve: Product names, API resource names, widely-known acronyms (REST API, HTTP, HTML, SQL)
   - Expand: Less common acronyms with definitions

4. Active Voice & Clarity
   - Replace passive voice with active voice
   - Use direct language
   - Add concrete examples when explaining abstract concepts

5. Strategic Linking
   - Link ONLY generic technical concepts (e.g., API Gateway, WebSocket, HTTP header)
   - DO NOT link: Company names, vendor names, brand names, or specific commercial products
   - Approved sources: Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) for web technologies, Wikipedia for others
   - NEVER fabricate or guess URLs - if unsure, leave unlinked

Output Structure:

Revised Text:
[Complete revised version with all simplifications applied, incorporating jargon explanations naturally within the text]

Explained Jargon:
[List all technical jargon terms simplified, using format:]
- [Technical term](URL): Brief explanation (1-5 words)
- Term without link: Concise explanation

Text to simplify:
{{text}}
```

## Key Features

### Reading Level Optimization
Targets Grade 8-9 reading level by replacing complex vocabulary, shortening sentences, and breaking up dense paragraphs.

### Strategic Linking
- Links generic technical concepts to Wikipedia or MDN
- Never links company names, vendor names, or commercial products
- Only uses verified URLs from approved sources (MDN, Wikipedia)

### Product Name Handling
- Preserves product names and API resource names
- Uses precise terminology (e.g., "client SDK" not "tool")
- Maintains code formatting and technical accuracy

### Output Format
Provides two sections:
1. **Revised Text**: Complete rewrite with jargon naturally explained inline
2. **Explained Jargon**: Reference list of all technical terms simplified

## Example

#### Input

```
Participants publish media to a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU). An SFU is a Media Server that decrypts the media, processes, re-encrypts, and routes the media tracks to the correct destinations. Media is not end-to-end encrypted, as the SFU performs a real-time decrypt-reencrypt step in memory when it routes the media to the participants. Clients only need to publish their media tracks once to the SFU, which clones and routes the media to the correct subscribers.
```

#### Output

```
<Revised_Text>
Participants publish media to a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU). An SFU is a Media Server that decrypts the media, processes, re-encrypts, and routes the media tracks to the correct destinations. Media is not end-to-end encrypted, as the SFU performs a real-time decrypt-reencrypt step in memory when it routes the media to the participants. Clients only need to publish their media tracks once to the SFU, which duplicates and routes the media to the correct subscribers.
</Revised_Text>

<Explained_Jargon>
- **Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU):** A Selective Forwarding Unit is a type of media server that manages the distribution of media streams by decrypting, processing, re-encrypting, and routing them.
- **Media Server:** A Media Server is a server that processes and distributes media streams.
- **Decrypt-reencrypt step:** This refers to the process where media is decrypted for processing and then re-encrypted before routing, indicating the media is not end-to-end encrypted.
- **Media tracks:** These are individual streams of audio or video data that are published by clients to the SFU.
- **Duplicates:** In this context, it means creating copies of media tracks to be sent to multiple subscribers.
</Explained_Jargon>

```
### Evaluation Notes

#### Edge Cases

- **Product/API Names**: Preserve product names and API resource names, not flagging or explaining them unless specifically requested.
- **Code Snippets**: Avoid modifying or explaining code unless specifically instructed.
- **Highly Technical Content**: Provide explanations rather than changing terminology when simplification risks losing precision.
- **Already Simple Content**: Detect when content is already accessible and avoid unnecessary changes.
- **Multiple Occurrences**: Explain terms only on first use to maintain clarity and avoid redundancy.

#### Failure Modes

- **Over-simplification**: Simplifies technical terms that are appropriate for the intended audience, losing necessary precision.
- **Under-simplification**: Misses jargon that would be unfamiliar to the target audience.
- **Incorrect Explanations**: Provides inaccurate explanations for highly technical or specialized terms.
- **Inconsistent Handling**: Handles the same term differently in different parts of the document.
- **Breaking Formatting**: Loses structural elements like bullet points or code formatting in the revised version.

#### Improvement Suggestions

1. Add a target audience parameter to adjust simplification level based on technical expertise.
2. Include an option to provide a custom glossary of terms that should or should not be simplified.
3. Add support for maintaining document structure, including headings, lists, and formatting.
4. Include readability score calculation in the output to measure accessibility.
5. Provide tiered simplification options (light, moderate, comprehensive) to suit different needs.

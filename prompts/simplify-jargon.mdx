# Simplify Jargon Prompt

This document provides an overview of the "Simplify Jargon" prompt, designed to make technical documentation more accessible by simplifying complex terms and defining acronyms. Contributors can use this guide to understand the prompt's functionality and suggest improvements.

## Prompt Overview

### Prompt

```
You are a specialized technical writing assistant designed to simplify complex technical content for Twilio's documentation while maintaining technical accuracy and implementing Twilio's style guide principles.

IMPORTANT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Do NOT use bold formatting with ** markdown anywhere in your entire response.
2. For general technical terms, include hyperlinks to relevant Wikipedia pages or MDN whenever available, using markdown format: "[WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC)".
3. CRUCIAL: Do NOT add any extra information or explanations that are not directly implied in the original text.
4. CRUCIAL: Incorporate technical jargon explanations directly within the revised text in a natural, flowing way.
5. Do NOT include any section markers (like "###" or "##") at the end of sections.

Primary Objectives:

1. Technical Jargon Identification and Explanation
   - Identify ALL technical jargon and complex terms
   - Replace complex terms with simpler alternatives without adding new information
   - Maintain a complete list of all technical terms with clear, concise explanations

2. Reading Level Optimization
   - Target: Grade 8-9 reading level
   - Replace complex vocabulary, shorten sentences, break up dense paragraphs

3. Technical Term Management
   - Define technical terms in plain language on first mention
   - Preserve: Twilio product names, API resource names, widely-known acronyms (REST API, HTTP, HTML, SQL)
   - Expand: Less common acronyms with definitions

4. Active Voice & Clarity
   - Replace passive voice with active voice
   - Use direct language
   - Add concrete examples when explaining abstract concepts

5. Strategic Linking
   - Link ONLY generic technical concepts (e.g., API Gateway, WebSocket, HTTP header)
   - DO NOT link: Company names, vendor names, brand names, or specific commercial products
   - Approved sources: Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) for web technologies, Wikipedia for others
   - NEVER fabricate or guess URLs - if unsure, leave unlinked

Output Structure:

Revised Text:
[Complete revised version with all simplifications applied, incorporating jargon explanations naturally within the text]

Explained Jargon:
[List all technical jargon terms simplified, using format:]
- [Technical term](URL): Brief explanation (1-5 words)
- Term without link: Concise explanation

Text to simplify:
{{text}}
```

## Key Features

### Reading Level Optimization
Targets Grade 8-9 reading level by replacing complex vocabulary, shortening sentences, and breaking up dense paragraphs.

### Strategic Linking
- Links generic technical concepts to Wikipedia or MDN
- Never links company names, vendor names, or commercial products
- Only uses verified URLs from approved sources (MDN, Wikipedia)

### Twilio-Specific Handling
- Preserves Twilio product names and API resource names
- Uses precise terminology (e.g., "client SDK" not "tool")
- Maintains code formatting and technical accuracy

### Output Format
Provides two sections:
1. **Revised Text**: Complete rewrite with jargon naturally explained inline
2. **Explained Jargon**: Reference list of all technical terms simplified

## Example

#### Input

```
The Twilio Voice SDK facilitates bidirectional audio streaming between endpoints by establishing persistent WebSocket connections to Twilio's edge infrastructure. When instantiating a Device instance, the SDK performs capability token validation and negotiates codec parameters with the gateway. The signaling plane utilizes a proprietary protocol for call state synchronization, while the media plane leverages SRTP for encrypted audio transport. Network traversal is accomplished through ICE candidate gathering, with STUN servers resolving public IP addresses and TURN servers relaying traffic when direct peer connectivity fails due to restrictive NAT configurations or firewall policies. The SDK implements adaptive bitrate algorithms to dynamically adjust codec parameters based on available bandwidth, packet loss metrics, and jitter measurements. For production deployments, you should implement exponential backoff retry logic to handle transient network failures and ensure idempotent request handling to prevent duplicate call initiation.
```

#### Output
```
<Revised_Content>
The Twilio Voice SDK facilitates two-way audio streaming between endpoints by establishing persistent WebSocket connections to Twilio's edge infrastructure. When creating a Device instance, the SDK performs capability token validation and negotiates codec parameters with the gateway. The signaling layer uses a proprietary protocol for call state synchronization, while the media layer utilizes Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for encrypted audio transport. Network traversal is accomplished through Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) candidate gathering, with Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) servers resolving public IP addresses and Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) servers relaying traffic when direct peer connectivity fails due to restrictive Network Address Translation (NAT) configurations or firewall policies. The SDK implements adaptive bitrate algorithms to dynamically adjust codec parameters based on available bandwidth, packet loss metrics, and jitter measurements. For production deployments, you should implement exponential backoff retry logic to handle temporary network failures and ensure idempotent request handling to prevent duplicate call initiation.

<Explained_Jargon>
- Bidirectional: Two-way
- WebSocket: A protocol for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
- Edge infrastructure: The network facilities that provide a connection point to the internet close to the user.
- Codec: A device or program that compresses data to enable faster transmission and decompresses received data.
- Signaling plane: The part of a network that carries control information.
- Media plane: The part of a network that carries the actual media or data.
- SRTP: Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol, a security profile for Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) adding encryption and message authentication.
- ICE: Interactive Connectivity Establishment, a framework used to allow web browsers to connect with peers.
- STUN: Session Traversal Utilities for NAT, a protocol for assisting devices behind NAT or firewall.
- TURN: Traversal Using Relays around NAT, a protocol that assists in relaying network traffic.
- NAT: Network Address Translation, a method of remapping IP address spaces.
- Adaptive bitrate algorithms: Techniques used to adjust the quality of a streaming media to match the bandwidth.
- Packet loss metrics: Measurements of data packets lost in transmission.
- Jitter measurements: Evaluations of the variability in packet arrival times.
- Exponential backoff retry logic: A strategy where retries are progressively delayed following a failure.
- Idempotent request handling: Ensuring that operations have the same effect regardless of how many

### Evaluation Notes

#### Edge Cases

- **Product/API Names**: Preserve product names and API resource names, not flagging or explaining them unless specifically requested.
- **Code Snippets**: Avoid modifying or explaining code unless specifically instructed.
- **Highly Technical Content**: Provide explanations rather than changing terminology when simplification risks losing precision.
- **Already Simple Content**: Detect when content is already accessible and avoid unnecessary changes.
- **Multiple Occurrences**: Explain terms only on first use to maintain clarity and avoid redundancy.

#### Failure Modes

- **Over-simplification**: Simplifies technical terms that are appropriate for the intended audience, losing necessary precision.
- **Under-simplification**: Misses jargon that would be unfamiliar to the target audience.
- **Incorrect Explanations**: Provides inaccurate explanations for highly technical or specialized terms.
- **Inconsistent Handling**: Handles the same term differently in different parts of the document.
- **Breaking Formatting**: Loses structural elements like bullet points or code formatting in the revised version.

#### Improvement Suggestions

1. Add a target audience parameter to adjust simplification level based on technical expertise.
2. Include an option to provide a custom glossary of terms that should or should not be simplified.
3. Add support for maintaining document structure, including headings, lists, and formatting.
4. Include readability score calculation in the output to measure accessibility.
5. Provide tiered simplification options (light, moderate, comprehensive) to suit different needs.

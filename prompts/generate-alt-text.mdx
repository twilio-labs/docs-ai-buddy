# Generate Alt Text Prompt

## Prompt

```
Create concise alt text for images in technical documentation by extracting essential text and describing key elements.

- Focus on useful, information-rich content using appropriate keywords.
- Ensure alt text is less than 125 characters.
- Identify specific image types like logos, illustrations, or cartoons.
- Avoid duplicating adjacent text.
- End the alt text with a period.
- Do not use semicolons.

# Steps

1. Extract text from the image.
2. Identify key elements to highlight.
3. Construct a concise, information-rich alt text sentence.
4. Ensure the alt text is under 125 characters and adheres to the guidelines.

# Output Format

Alt text should be a single sentence, ending with a period, and less than 125 characters long.

{{imagePath}}
```

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input

An image of a setup screen for a button configuration tool that shows fields for URL and phone number.

#### Output

```
Call to Action button setup with options for Visit website or Phone, including fields for URL and phone number.
```

### Example 2

#### Input

A screenshot of an error message dialog showing "Failed to connect to service. Error code: 4032"

#### Output

```
Error dialog showing "Failed to connect to service" with error code 4032.
```

### Example 3

#### Input

A diagram showing a flowchart of API authentication steps with boxes for "Request Token", "Validate Credentials", and "Return Access Token".

#### Output

```
Flowchart showing API authentication process with three steps: Request Token, Validate Credentials, and Return Access Token.
```

## Evaluation Notes

### Edge Cases

- **Images with Excessive Text**: Prioritize the most important information to stay within the character limit.
- **Low Quality or Blurry Images**: Focus on what can be reasonably identified.
- **Complex Technical Diagrams**: Provide a high-level summary rather than describing every element.
- **Screenshots with UI Elements**: Focus on the purpose of the UI rather than describing every button and element.
- **Images with Multiple Distinct Sections**: Prioritize the main subject while acknowledging other important elements.

### Failure Modes

- **Exceeding Character Limit**: May generate alt text that exceeds the 125 character limit, requiring truncation.
- **Missing Critical Information**: Might focus on less important visual elements while missing the core purpose of the image.
- **Over-describing**: Can sometimes provide excessive detail for simple images, adding unnecessary information.
- **Misidentification**: May incorrectly identify elements in complex or ambiguous images.
- **Generic Descriptions**: Sometimes generates vague descriptions that don't add meaningful context (e.g., "Screenshot of a webpage").

### Improvement Suggestions

1. Add functionality to handle image context from surrounding document text.
2. Implement tiered alt text generation (brief and detailed versions).
3. Create specialized handling for common technical image types (code snippets, API responses, error messages).
4. Add option to generate both alt text and longer descriptions for complex images.
5. Implement detection for decorative images that may require minimal alt text.

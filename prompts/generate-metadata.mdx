### Evaluation Notes

#### Edge Cases

- **Very Technical Content**: Focus on clarity while maintaining accuracy of technical concepts.
- **Multiple Key Topics**: Prioritize the most important aspects for the metadata.
- **Very Short Content**: Extract the core value proposition without embellishment.
- **Content with Code Examples**: Focus on the purpose of the code rather than specific implementation details.
- **Marketing-Heavy Content**: Extract substantive information and present it in a direct, technical manner.

#### Failure Modes

- **Exceeding Character Limits**: May generate titles or descriptions that exceed the specified character limits.
- **Starting with Brand Names**: May incorrectly start titles with brand names despite instructions.
- **Generic Descriptions**: Sometimes produces vague descriptions that don't capture the unique value of the content.
- **Keyword Stuffing**: May overload metadata with keywords at the expense of readability.
- **Missing Key Value Propositions**: Might focus on secondary aspects while missing the primary purpose of the content.

#### Improvement Suggestions

1. Add keyword targeting option to focus metadata on specific search terms.
2. Include competitor analysis to differentiate content positioning.
3. Implement A/B testing capability with multiple metadata variants.
4. Add support for localization considerations in different markets.
5. Create vertical-specific optimizations for different industries.
